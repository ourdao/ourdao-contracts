# OurDAO — Stellar Soroban Lending DAO

[![CI](https://github.com/ourdao/ourdao-contracts/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ourdao/ourdao-contracts/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](./LICENSE)

A member-owned lending DAO implemented as a single [Soroban](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts) smart contract in Rust — 2,300+ lines across 13 focused modules, 31 unit tests, CI-gated on every push.

The execution model, storage layout, authorization, and value transfer are all Soroban-native. All DAO value flows through a single configurable token set at initialization (USDC, XLM via the Stellar Asset Contract, or any Stellar asset).

This repository is one of three that make up OurDAO:

| Repo | Role |
|---|---|
| **`ourdao-contracts`** (this repo) | The Soroban contract — the single source of truth for all DAO state |
| [`ourdao-backend`](https://github.com/ourdao/ourdao-backend) | Off-chain indexer + read API, since Soroban keeps no queryable history |
| [`ourdao-frontend`](https://github.com/ourdao/ourdao-frontend) | Next.js web app members actually use |

## What the DAO does

- **Governance** — a set of admins, a basis-points consensus threshold (default 51%), and a tunable loan policy. Admins can be added/removed (the last admin can never be removed, preventing a bricked DAO), the threshold and policy can be updated, and the whole contract can be paused/unpaused in an emergency.
- **Membership** — anyone can join by paying a membership fee in the DAO token; the fee becomes their pro-rata share in the treasury. A member who exits (and has no active loan) withdraws their share, their staked balance, and any pending yield in a single transaction. Rejoining after exit is handled correctly — it doesn't double-count a member's original contribution.
- **Lending** — members request loans that go through a fixed editable draft phase, then member voting weighted by stake-boosted voting power. On reaching the consensus threshold the loan is automatically approved and the principal disbursed from the treasury — no separate "execute" step. Interest is computed from a loan-size-relative-to-treasury curve, clamped to the policy's min/max rate. Repaying a loan returns the principal to the treasury and splits the interest across all active members as claimable yield.
- **Loan defaults** — an overdue loan (past `due_time` plus a configurable grace period) can be marked defaulted by **anyone**, not just an admin — an on-chain keeper pattern. Defaulting slashes a policy-defined share of the borrower's treasury claim and frees their `has_active_loan` flag, so they can still exit the DAO with their reduced share or borrow again after the normal cooldown. This closes what was previously the DAO's most notable functional gap: prior to this, an overdue loan had zero on-chain consequence.
- **Treasury** — any member can propose a withdrawal to any destination; execution requires a higher (60%) consensus than loan approval, reflecting the larger blast radius of moving treasury funds arbitrarily.
- **Safety** — admin pause/unpause blocks all state-changing operations instantly, and extensive view functions let any client inspect full DAO state without needing an indexer for real-time reads.

## Additional feature modules

Four Soroban-native features beyond the core lending/treasury flow, each fully implemented — not stubbed out:

| Feature | Description | Module |
|---|---|---|
| Name registry | On-chain **name registry** (name ⇄ address, 1:1) | `registry.rs` |
| Content-hash metadata | Anchor an IPFS CID / digest to a loan or treasury proposal | `docs.rs` |
| Commit-reveal voting | **Commit-reveal voting** for private treasury proposals (`sha256(support ++ salt)`, revealed later, tallied through the same code path as public votes) | `privacy.rs` |
| Staking | **Staking** for a capped voting-weight boost (1 base vote + up to 5 bonus, 100 token units per bonus vote), tracked separately so staked funds are never lent out or counted as treasury | `staking.rs` |

## Architecture & design decisions

- **Single-contract design.** Every module (`admin`, `membership`, `loans`, `treasury`, `registry`, `docs`, `privacy`, `staking`) lives inside one `#[contract]` struct (`lib.rs`) rather than being split into separate deployed contracts. This keeps cross-module invariants (e.g. a member's `has_active_loan` flag, staked funds excluded from treasury balance) enforceable in normal Rust function calls instead of cross-contract calls.
- **`loan.id == proposal.id`, always.** A loan proposal that gets approved disburses exactly one loan, so the loan reuses the proposal's own id rather than drawing from a separate counter. This was a deliberate fix (see the [`Known limitations`](#known-limitations) history below) — two independent counters looked harmless but silently diverged the moment any proposal was rejected, breaking the off-chain indexer's ability to correlate a loan back to the request that created it.
- **Permissionless default-marking.** `mark_loan_defaulted` requires no admin authorization and no caller-side auth at all — it's a pure, objective, time-based state transition (like a keeper bot pattern), not a privileged action. Anyone can call it once the on-chain clock says a loan is overdue.
- **Commit-reveal privacy shares the public tally path.** Rather than duplicating vote-counting logic for private proposals, `privacy::reveal_vote` recomputes and checks the commitment, then hands off to the *same* `treasury::tally` function public votes use — one code path, no risk of the two diverging.
- **TTL-aware storage.** All persistent storage entries (members, loans, proposals, votes, stakes, documents) extend their time-to-live on every read/write (30-day bump for instance storage, 90-day for persistent), so active DAO data doesn't silently expire under Soroban's [state archival](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/learn/encyclopedia/storage/state-archival) model.
- **Stable, append-only error codes.** `error.rs`'s numeric codes are documented as part of the contract's public ABI — new failure modes get a new number rather than renumbering existing ones, so client code that matches on error codes doesn't silently break across contract upgrades (see [Known limitations](#known-limitations) — there is currently no upgrade path at all, which makes this moot today but is kept as forward-looking discipline).

## Public interface (ABI)

All entrypoints are on the `OurDao` contract (`lib.rs`). Errors are the numeric [`Error`](#error-codes) codes below.

**Lifecycle / governance**

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `initialize(admins, consensus_threshold, membership_fee, token, policy)` | One-time setup. |
| `add_admin(caller, admin)` / `remove_admin(caller, admin)` | Admin-only. The last admin can never be removed. |
| `set_consensus_threshold(caller, threshold)` | Admin-only, basis points. |
| `set_loan_policy(caller, policy)` | Admin-only. |
| `pause(caller)` / `unpause(caller)` | Admin-only emergency stop. |

**Membership**

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `register_member(member)` | Pays the membership fee, joins the DAO. |
| `exit_dao(member)` | Withdraws pro-rata share + stake + pending yield. Blocked while `has_active_loan`. |
| `claim_rewards(member)` | Withdraws accrued loan-interest yield. |

**Lending**

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `request_loan(borrower, amount) -> proposal_id` | Opens a loan proposal (3-day editing window). |
| `edit_loan_proposal(borrower, proposal_id, new_amount)` | Only during the editing window, only the borrower. |
| `vote_on_loan_proposal(voter, proposal_id, support)` | Auto-approves and disburses at the consensus threshold. |
| `repay_loan(borrower, loan_id)` | Collects the full outstanding balance in one transaction. |
| `repay_loan_partial(borrower, loan_id, amount)` | Collects up to `amount` of the outstanding balance. Applies to accrued interest first, then principal; the loan flips to repaid only once the balance reaches exactly zero. |
| `mark_loan_defaulted(loan_id)` | **Permissionless.** Callable once `due_time + grace_period` has elapsed. |
| `expire_loan_proposal(proposal_id)` | **Permissionless keeper call.** Persists the expired state for a proposal whose voting window has passed without reaching quorum. No-op on repeat calls. |

**Treasury**

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `propose_treasury_withdrawal(proposer, amount, destination, reason, private) -> proposal_id` | `private` routes it through commit-reveal instead of open voting. |
| `vote_on_treasury_proposal(voter, proposal_id, support)` | Auto-executes at 60% consensus. Rejected on a private proposal — use commit/reveal instead. |

**Staking**

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `stake(member, amount)` / `unstake(member, amount)` | Boosts voting weight; kept separate from lendable treasury. |

**Name registry**

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `register_name(owner, name)` | 1:1 name ⇄ address; re-registering frees the owner's previous name. Names must be 3–32 chars, ASCII lowercase alphanumeric plus `-` and `_`, with no leading/trailing separator. |
| `resolve_name(name) -> Option<Address>` / `name_of(owner) -> Option<String>` | Views. |

**Commit-reveal voting**

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `commit_treasury_vote(voter, proposal_id, commitment)` | `commitment = sha256(support_byte ++ salt)`. |
| `reveal_treasury_vote(voter, proposal_id, support, salt)` | Verifies the commitment, then tallies through the shared path. |

**Content-hash documents**

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `attach_document(caller, kind, proposal_id, content_hash)` | Anchors an off-chain content hash (e.g. IPFS CID) to a real loan/treasury proposal. |
| `get_document(kind, proposal_id) -> Option<Bytes>` | View. |

**Views** — `get_member`, `get_loan`, `get_loan_proposal` (auto-refreshes expired phase), `get_treasury_proposal`, `get_loan_policy`, `get_admins`, `is_admin`, `is_member`, `is_eligible_for_loan`, `get_treasury_balance`, `get_total_members`, `get_active_members`, `get_consensus_threshold`, `get_token`, `is_paused`, `get_stake`, `get_pending_yield`, `calculate_loan_terms`, `calculate_exit_share`, `has_voted(kind, proposal_id, voter)`.

## Event catalog

Every state-changing call publishes an event, which `ourdao-backend` indexes since Soroban itself keeps no queryable history. Topic symbol → data tuple:

| Symbol | Data | Emitted by |
|---|---|---|
| `init` | `(admins, threshold, fee, token)` | `initialize` |
| `admin_add` / `admin_rem` | `admin` | `add_admin` / `remove_admin` |
| `threshold` | `threshold` | `set_consensus_threshold` |
| `policy` / `paused` / `unpaused` | — | `set_loan_policy` / `pause` / `unpause` |
| `joined` | `(member, fee)` | `register_member` |
| `exited` | `(member, share)` | `exit_dao` |
| `claimed` | `(member, pending)` | `claim_rewards` |
| `loan_req` | `(id, borrower, amount, total_repayment)` | `request_loan` |
| `loan_edit` | `(proposal_id, borrower, new_amount, total_repayment)` | `edit_loan_proposal` |
| `loan_vote` | `(proposal_id, voter, support)` | `vote_on_loan_proposal` |
| `loan_appr` | `(id, borrower, amount)` | auto-fired on approval — `id` is both the loan's and its proposal's id |
| `loan_rpy` | `(loan_id, borrower, outstanding)` | `repay_loan` / `repay_loan_partial` — `outstanding` is the balance still remaining *after* this payment (0 for a payment that fully repays the loan) |
| `loan_dflt` | `(loan_id, borrower, penalty)` | `mark_loan_defaulted` |
| `loan_exp` | `(proposal_id, borrower)` | `expire_loan_proposal` (permissionless keeper) |
| `interest` | `(interest, active_members)` | fired alongside `loan_rpy` |
| `tre_prop` | `(id, amount, destination, private)` | `propose_treasury_withdrawal` |
| `tre_vote` | `(id, voter, support)` | `vote_on_treasury_proposal` |
| `tre_exec` | `(id, amount, destination)` | auto-fired on execution |
| `staked` / `unstaked` | `(member, amount, new_stake)` | `stake` / `unstake` |
| `name_reg` | `(name, owner)` | `register_name` |
| `committed` | `(proposal_id, voter)` | `commit_treasury_vote` |
| `revealed` | `(proposal_id, voter, support)` | `reveal_treasury_vote` |
| `doc_attn` | `(kind, proposal_id, caller)` | `attach_document` |

## Error codes

Numeric codes are stable and part of the ABI — new variants get appended rather than renumbering existing ones.

| Range | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 1–7 | Lifecycle/config: `AlreadyInitialized`, `NotInitialized`, `InvalidThreshold`, `InvalidAmount`, `InvalidLoanPolicy`, `Paused`, `NotPaused` |
| 10–15 | Authorization: `NotAuthorized`, `NotAdmin`, `NotMember`, `AlreadyAdmin`, `AlreadyMember`, `CannotRemoveLastAdmin` |
| 20–21 | Membership: `MemberNotActive`, `HasActiveLoan` |
| 30–42 | Loans: `ProposalNotFound`, `NotBorrower`, `NotInEditingPhase`, `NotInVotingPhase`, `VotingEnded`, `AlreadyVoted`, `NotEligibleForLoan`, `CooldownActive`, `LoanNotFound`, `LoanNotActive`, `ExceedsTreasuryRatio`, `InsufficientTreasury`, `LoanNotOverdue` |
| 50 | Treasury: `TreasuryProposalNotFound` |
| 60–67 | Native-swap modules: `NameTaken`, `NameNotFound`, `NoStake`, `InsufficientStake`, `NoCommitment`, `CommitmentMismatch`, `AlreadyRevealed`, `NothingToClaim` |
| 70–72 | Appended: `ProposalNotExpired`, `InvalidName`, `NotYetRevealed` |

## Build & test

Requires the Rust `wasm32v1-none` target (Rust 1.84+) and the [`stellar` CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/stellar-cli).

```bash
# Native unit tests — including loan defaults, commit-reveal privacy,
# staking-boosted voting, and property tests over the exit-share, interest,
# and staking-weight math
cargo test

# Formatting check (matches CI)
cargo fmt --check

# Lint (matches CI — warnings fail the build)
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Dependency advisories (matches CI, informational — see the audit job note below)
cargo install cargo-audit --locked # one-time
cargo audit

# Release wasm
cargo build --target wasm32v1-none --release

# Optimized, deployment-ready wasm
stellar contract build --optimize
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo test`, and the wasm build in one job on every push and PR. A separate `audit` job runs `cargo audit` on the same triggers — it's split out so a newly published advisory (which can land against a pin we already know about and can't move, like the one below) surfaces visibly without blocking merges on unrelated PRs.

> **Note on dependencies:** `Cargo.lock` pins `ed25519-dalek` to `2.2.0`. A newer
> transitive release (`3.0.0`) is incompatible with the pinned `rand_core` used by
> `soroban-env-host` and breaks the test build if allowed to float. The lockfile is
> committed to keep builds reproducible.

## Deploy to testnet

The quickest path is the helper script, which creates and funds a deployer
identity (via friendbot), builds the optimized wasm, deploys, and prints the
contract id plus a ready-to-edit `initialize` command:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-testnet.sh
```

Override the defaults with environment variables if needed:

```bash
IDENTITY=my-key NETWORK=testnet ALIAS=ourdao-dao ./scripts/deploy-testnet.sh
```

Or deploy manually:

```bash
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32v1-none/release/ourdao_dao.optimized.wasm \
  --network testnet \
  --source <your-identity> \
  --alias ourdao-dao
```

After deploying, initialize the DAO with your admin set, consensus threshold
(bps), membership fee, DAO token contract id, and loan policy. The script
prints a filled-in example; the token id can be the testnet USDC contract or
the native XLM Stellar Asset Contract (`stellar contract id asset --asset native --network testnet`).

## Security notes

- **No reentrancy surface.** Soroban's execution model has no arbitrary external calls back into the contract mid-execution from an untrusted token, but all balance-changing operations still follow check-effects-interactions ordering (state updated before/alongside the token transfer, not after).
- **Auth is enforced per-call, not assumed.** Every state-changing entrypoint that moves a specific member's funds or represents their vote calls `require_auth()` on that member's own address — a caller cannot act on behalf of another address.
- **`mark_loan_defaulted` is intentionally unauthenticated.** This is a deliberate design choice, not an oversight: the action is purely a function of on-chain time and existing loan state, so there is nothing to authorize — restricting it to admins would just add unnecessary liveness risk (an admin going offline shouldn't block defaults from being recorded).
- **This contract has not been externally audited.** It is a testnet-stage prototype. Do not deploy to mainnet with real value without an independent security review first.

## Known limitations

- **No upgrade path.** The contract is immutable once deployed — a deliberate trust-minimization tradeoff, not an oversight. Migrating to a new version requires a fresh deployment and an explicit migration path for existing members' balances.
- **Testnet-only deploy tooling**, consistent with this project's current testnet-stage positioning.
- ~~Loan defaults had zero on-chain consequence~~ — fixed; see [What the DAO does](#what-the-dao-does).
- ~~`loan.id` could silently diverge from its originating `proposal.id`~~ — fixed by removing the separate loan-id counter; a loan now always reuses its proposal's id, with a regression test locking in the invariant.
- ~~Interest distribution was O(n) over every member~~ — fixed with a pull-based yield accumulator: O(1) on repay, each member settles lazily on claim/exit.

## Roadmap

- External security audit before any mainnet consideration.
- A documented upgrade/migration path.
- Deeper integration testing against `ourdao-backend`'s indexer (event schema drift detection).
