// ==================== issue #7: property tests ====================
//
// The example tests in the sibling modules pin down behavior at specific, hand-picked numbers.
// These instead generate wide ranges of inputs (amounts, treasury sizes,
// stakes, contributions — including near-`i128::MAX` boundaries) and check
// invariants that must hold for *any* input, not just the ones a human
// happened to write down. `amount` inputs are capped at `AMOUNT_BOUND`
// (rather than the full `i128` range) specifically to stay clear of the
// *intermediate* overflow in `amount * BASIS_POINTS` — the invariants below
// are about the post-clamp behavior of these functions, not about auditing
// every arithmetic op in isolation.

/// Keeps `amount * BASIS_POINTS` (BASIS_POINTS == 10_000) well clear of
/// i128 overflow while still exercising values many orders of magnitude
/// larger than any real loan or treasury.
