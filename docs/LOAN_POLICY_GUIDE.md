# LoanPolicy Parameter Guide

`LoanPolicy` has twelve tunable parameters that control who can borrow, how
much, at what rate, and what happens when a loan goes wrong. This document
explains each parameter: what it controls, its units, its interactions with
other parameters, and a suggested starting value.

The final section provides a worked example for a small DAO and calls out
pathological combinations explicitly.

---

## Parameter reference

### `min_membership_duration: u64`
**Units:** seconds since Unix epoch, stored in `Member.join_time`.
**What it controls:** How long a member must have been in the DAO before
they can request a loan.  
**Interactions:** Read against `member.join_time` at loan-request time.
Setting this above the typical membership age of your DAO members will make
lending impossible in practice until enough time has passed.  
**Suggested start:** `2_592_000` (30 days). Long enough to filter drive-by
borrowers; short enough not to strand early members.

---

### `membership_contribution: i128`
**Units:** token stroops (the DAO's native token, smallest unit).  
**What it controls:** The minimum contribution a member must have on record
to be eligible for a loan. Set this to the membership fee to require that a
member has not been slashed below the threshold.  
**Interactions:** Read against `member.contribution` at loan-request time.
If a member's contribution has been reduced by a default penalty, they may
fall below this threshold.  
**Suggested start:** equal to the membership fee (e.g., `1_000`).

---

### `max_loan_duration: u64`
**Units:** seconds.  
**What it controls:** The maximum repayment term a borrower can request.  
**Interactions:** Combined with `default_grace_period`, this sets the outer
boundary on how long a defaulted loan can sit before it becomes markable.
A very long `max_loan_duration` plus a long `grace_period` can leave bad
debt open for years.  
**Suggested start:** `2_592_000` (30 days).  
**Validation:** Must be non-zero. `validate_policy` does not cap this, so
choose carefully.

---

### `min_interest_rate: u32` and `max_interest_rate: u32`
**Units:** basis points (1 bp = 0.01%; 10_000 bp = 100%).  
**What they control:** The linear interest-rate curve. A small loan relative
to the treasury gets `min_interest_rate`; a loan at the maximum ratio gets
`max_interest_rate`. Any amount in between is interpolated linearly and
clamped to this range.  
**Interactions:** The property test `loan_terms_rate_stays_within_policy_bounds`
verifies that the quoted rate is always within `[min, max]`.  
**Constraint:** `min_interest_rate <= max_interest_rate`; both must be ≤
10_000 (100%).  
**Suggested start:** `min = 500` (5%), `max = 2_000` (20%).

---

### `cooldown_period: u64`
**Units:** seconds.  
**What it controls:** How long a borrower must wait after their last loan
before requesting another. Read against `member.last_loan_time`.  
**Interactions:** `last_loan_time` is a Unix timestamp. A `cooldown_period`
of 0 allows back-to-back borrowing.  
**Suggested start:** `2_592_000` (30 days). Prevents serial borrowers from
monopolising treasury liquidity.

---

### `max_loan_to_treasury_ratio: u32`
**Units:** basis points of the treasury balance at loan-request time.  
**What it controls:** The ceiling on any single loan as a fraction of the
live treasury.  
**Pathological value — `0`:** A ratio of 0 makes **every loan impossible**
while still passing `validate_policy` (see [#53]). Do not set this to 0.  
**Suggested start:** `2_000` (20%). Limits exposure to any single borrower.

---

### `default_grace_period: u64`
**Units:** seconds.  
**What it controls:** Extra time after `Loan.due_time` before an admin can
call `mark_loan_defaulted`. This gives a late borrower a window to repay
without being defaulted.  
**Interactions:** During a pause, `mark_loan_defaulted` is blocked, so a
loan can silently pass `due_time + grace_period` and become instantly
markable on unpause. See [INCIDENT_RUNBOOK.md](./INCIDENT_RUNBOOK.md).  
**Suggested start:** `259_200` (3 days).

---

### `default_penalty_bps: u32`
**Units:** basis points of `member.contribution`.  
**What it controls:** How much of a defaulting borrower's on-record contribution
is slashed on default. This amount is burned (removed from the treasury's
accounting of their stake), not redistributed.  
**Interactions:** Slashing can reduce `member.contribution` below
`membership_contribution`, making the member ineligible for future loans.  
**Suggested start:** `2_000` (20%).  
**Constraint:** Must be ≤ 10_000 (100%).

---

### `editing_period: u64`
**Units:** seconds.  
**What it controls:** How long a loan proposal stays in the `Editing` phase
before it advances to `Voting`. The borrower can edit terms during this window.  
**Interactions:** `editing_period + voting_period` determines the total elapsed
time from proposal to decision. Capital is effectively committed during this
window because `disburse_approved_loan` can only be called after voting closes.  
**Constraint:** Must be non-zero and ≤ `30 * 24 * 60 * 60` (30 days).  
**Suggested start:** `259_200` (3 days).

---

### `voting_period: u64`
**Units:** seconds.  
**What it controls:** How long voting is open on a proposal.  
**Interactions:** See `editing_period` above.  
**Constraint:** Must be non-zero and ≤ 30 days.  
**Suggested start:** `259_200` (3 days).

---

### `treasury_threshold: u32`
**Units:** basis points of the total weighted vote.  
**What it controls:** The approval threshold for treasury-withdrawal proposals
(not loan proposals — those use `consensus_threshold`).  
**Constraint:** Must be non-zero and ≤ 10_000 (100%).  
**Suggested start:** `5_100` (51%).

## Interest curve formula and spread

`calculate_loan_terms` computes a utilization-sensitive rate from the requested
loan amount and the current lendable treasury balance.

Let:

- `A` = requested loan amount
- `T` = current treasury balance, excluding staked principal
- `B` = `10_000` basis points
- `r_min` = `min_interest_rate`
- `r_max` = `max_interest_rate`
- `s = r_max - r_min` = configured rate spread

The contract first calculates the loan ratio:

```text
loan_ratio = min(A * B / T, B)
```

For an empty treasury, `loan_ratio` is treated as `B`, which quotes the
maximum rate. The interest rate is then:

```text
rate = min(r_min + loan_ratio * s / B, r_max)
total_repayment = A + A * rate / B
```

With a 5% floor and 20% ceiling, the spread is 1,500 bp:

| Loan / treasury | Ratio (bp) | Quoted rate | Meaning |
|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 0% | 0 | 5.00% | Minimum policy rate |
| 10% | 1,000 | 6.50% | Low utilization |
| 20% | 2,000 | 8.00% | Typical conservative ceiling |
| 50% | 5,000 | 12.50% | Material concentration risk |
| 100%+ | 10,000 | 20.00% | Maximum policy rate |

This curve prices larger treasury exposures more aggressively without adding a
discontinuous rate jump. Governance should consider both the spread and the
maximum permitted loan-to-treasury ratio: a high maximum ratio with a narrow
spread can underprice concentration risk.

---

## Default penalty mechanics

After `due_time + default_grace_period`, anyone may call
`mark_loan_defaulted`. The contract then:

1. marks the active loan `Defaulted`;
2. computes `penalty = contribution * default_penalty_bps / 10_000`;
3. caps the penalty at the member's recorded contribution;
4. subtracts the penalty from the member and total-contribution accounting; and
5. clears `has_active_loan`, allowing the member to exit with their reduced
   economic claim.

The penalty does **not** repay missing principal and is not a substitute for
liquidity reserves. It is a governance deterrent and loss-allocation tool.

| Penalty | Member contribution | Amount slashed | Contribution remaining |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 10% | 1,000 | 100 | 900 |
| 20% | 1,000 | 200 | 800 |
| 50% | 1,000 | 500 | 500 |
| 100% | 1,000 | 1,000 | 0 |

A penalty that leaves contribution below `membership_contribution` also makes
the member ineligible for another loan until their contribution again satisfies
policy.

## Governance tuning guidelines

When changing lending policy, governors should evaluate parameters as one risk
budget rather than independently:

1. **Set exposure first.** Choose `max_loan_to_treasury_ratio` from the maximum
   single-borrower loss the DAO can absorb without impairing operations.
2. **Price that exposure.** Set the min/max interest spread so the maximum
   permitted exposure is meaningfully more expensive than a small loan.
3. **Match duration to liquidity.** Longer loan durations lock treasury
   liquidity for longer and should generally be paired with lower exposure
   limits or a larger liquid reserve.
4. **Treat penalties as deterrence, not collateral.** A contribution penalty
   can be much smaller than outstanding principal; do not assume it makes the
   treasury whole.
5. **Keep grace periods operationally realistic.** The grace period should be
   long enough for accidental late repayment, but short enough that bad debt is
   surfaced promptly.
6. **Model correlated borrowing.** The per-loan ratio limits one loan, not the
   sum of all active loans. Governance should monitor aggregate outstanding
   principal off-chain when setting aggressive ratios.
7. **Stage large parameter changes.** For material changes, publish the proposed
   before/after values and run the worked calculations above before voting.

### Suggested risk profiles

| Profile | Max loan / treasury | Rate floor → ceiling | Grace period | Default penalty |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Conservative | 10% | 5% → 25% | 2 days | 30% |
| Balanced | 20% | 5% → 20% | 3 days | 20% |
| Growth-oriented | 30% | 4% → 18% | 5 days | 15% |

These are starting points, not guarantees of solvency. A DAO should adapt them
to treasury volatility, borrower concentration, governance participation, and
the liquidity needs of its members.

## Pathological combinations

| Combination | Effect |
|---|---|
| `max_loan_to_treasury_ratio = 0` | Rejected by `validate_policy`; governance must choose a non-zero exposure ceiling. |
| `editing_period + voting_period` > members' patience | Proposals expire before gathering quorum; effective lending rate approaches zero. |
| `max_loan_duration` >> `default_grace_period` | A defaulted loan can sit in limbo for the full loan duration before anyone can act. |
| `min_membership_duration` > age of the DAO | No member is old enough to borrow. |
| `cooldown_period` > `max_loan_duration` | A borrower cannot request a second loan until the cooldown clears, even if they repaid early. Usually fine; document if intentional. |

Which parameters are effectively permanent once obligations exist: any parameter
that is read live against open loans (`max_loan_duration`, `min_interest_rate`,
`max_interest_rate`, `default_grace_period`, `default_penalty_bps`) is safe to
change for future loans but affects how existing open loans appear relative to
the new policy. A retroactive-policy issue is tracked separately in this repo.

## Worked example: small DAO (5–20 members)

```rust
LoanPolicy {
    min_membership_duration: 2_592_000,   // 30 days — filters drive-by joiners
    membership_contribution: 1_000,       // equal to the membership fee
    max_loan_duration: 2_592_000,         // 30 days
    min_interest_rate: 500,               // 5%  — floor for any loan
    max_interest_rate: 2_000,             // 20% — ceiling for max-ratio loans
    cooldown_period: 2_592_000,           // 30 days — one loan per month max
    max_loan_to_treasury_ratio: 2_000,    // 20% of treasury per loan
    default_grace_period: 259_200,        // 3 days past due_time
    default_penalty_bps: 2_000,           // 20% contribution slashed on default
    editing_period: 259_200,              // 3 days editing
    voting_period: 259_200,               // 3 days voting
    treasury_threshold: 5_100,            // 51% approval for treasury withdrawals
}
```

**Reasoning:**
- 30-day membership minimum and cooldown protect against hit-and-run borrowers.
- 20% treasury ratio means a single loan can't empty the DAO, but is large
  enough to be useful.
- 5–20% rate range rewards the DAO fairly while staying below predatory rates.
- 3-day editing + voting keeps decisions moving without rushing members.
- 3-day grace period gives honest borrowers a short buffer without leaving bad
  debt open for long.
- 51% threshold for treasury withdrawals matches the consensus threshold,
  keeping governance consistent.
